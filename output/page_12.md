# Guiding Your AI with Prompts \& Temperature 

- System prompts guide the LLM's behavior
- Define purpose, personality, knowledge, output format
- Example: "You are a helpful AI assistant. Provide concise answers."
- Well-crafted prompts key to good results
- Temperature: Randomness of LLM's outputs
- Low temp: Focused, deterministic, less creative
- High temp: More random, creative, less focused
- Adjust temperature based on task (e.g. low for factual Q\&A, high for story generation)
